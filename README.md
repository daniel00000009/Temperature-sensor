# Temperature-sensor
This code will allow you to control a heat source with a microcontroler and a temperature sensor(DHT11). Kp, Ki, Kd were calculated with matlab.
For this project to work, you will need to follow the code and connect the pins properly on your microcontroller. Additionally, you should be aware of which pins can generate a PWM signal. 
The most crucial step before assembling the project is to read the datasheet for every component you have. 
This will allow you to make the necessary connections and ensure that you don't make any mistakes.
