# Temperature-sensor

This code enables the control of a heat source using a microcontroller and a temperature sensor (DHT11). The values for Kp, Ki, and Kd have been computed using Matlab.

For the successful implementation of this project, it is imperative to meticulously follow the provided code and appropriately connect the pins on your microcontroller. Additionally, a keen understanding of which pins are capable of generating a PWM signal is essential.

The pivotal prerequisite prior to assembling the project is to thoroughly read the datasheet for each component in your possession. This will facilitate the establishment of necessary connections and ensure the prevention of any inadvertent errors.
